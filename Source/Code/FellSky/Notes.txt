Boarding mini-game:
	- Consists of a list of battle reports from boarding party.
	- Boarding party radios status
	- If party spots something interesting, the game presents choices from which player must pick
		Example points of interest:
			Room with sapients
			Engine room
			Bridge
			Corridor
			~etc~
	- When combat occurs, it happens in real-time
	- UI displays status of team members
		- Team member UI reflects health and damage
		- Health is a oscilloscope-type health meter, which shows condition via color, and stress via frequency of beats
	- Player can give commands, like:
		- Go silent / Go loud

		- trigger special commands
			- cut life support, 
			- fire support from ship, 
			- trigger planted explosives
			- retreat

		





Dynamic Tech Generation

Tech progress is driven by:
	Scanning anomalies during exploration or combat.
		Anomalies can be found in 
			- space
			- surface
			- events during battle
	Buying tech and intel
	Scanning items
	Questioning sapients
	Interrogating prisoners


Exploring finds Anomalies.
Scanning Anomalies generates Data.
Research on Data generates Breakthroughs.

A Research Breakthrough gives a choice of three:

1. Upgrade to a stat of an existing Applied tech
2. Progress to a Tech's level.
3. A new Tech
